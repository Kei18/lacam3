      Comparison with previous LaCAM* (IJCAI-23) on random-32-32-20 with 409 agents and 30s timeout.
      Their initial solutions were found in ~100ms.
      This paper aims to obtain near-optimal solutions even with large MAPF problems within a limited time.
      Note that LaCAM* eventually converges to optimal solutions.

  <p>
  This paper addresses the challenges of <span class="text-danger">real-time, large-scale, and near-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)</span> through enhancements to the recently proposed <span class="text-danger">LaCAM*</span> algorithm.
  LaCAM* is a scalable search-based algorithm that guarantees the eventual finding of optimal solutions for cumulative transition costs.
  While it has demonstrated remarkable planning success rates, surpassing various state-of-the-art MAPF methods, its initial solution quality is far from optimal, and its convergence speed to the optimum is slow.
  To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces several improvement techniques, partly drawing inspiration from other MAPF methods.
  We provide empirical evidence that the fusion of these techniques significantly improves the solution quality of LaCAM*, thus further pushing the boundaries of MAPF algorithms.
